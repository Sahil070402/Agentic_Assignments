# Majorly Spreading Diseases in 2024: A Detailed Summary

In 2024, several infectious diseases have been spreading widely across the globe, causing significant public health challenges. This summary compiles the latest data and insights from leading health organizations such as the CDC, WHO, Johns Hopkins, and others.

## 1. Dengue Fever
- The year 2024 recorded over 12 million dengue cases worldwide, an unprecedented surge.
- Hospitalizations have increased notably due to severe forms of the disease.
- The disease primarily affects tropical and subtropical regions where mosquito vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) are prevalent.

## 2. Respiratory Illnesses (COVID-19, Influenza, RSV)
- COVID-19 continues to circulate with new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerging, requiring continual updates to vaccines.
- Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections remain significant causes of respiratory illness, especially among children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.
- These viruses contribute collectively to a high burden of respiratory disease globally.

## 3. Mpox (Monkeypox)
- Ongoing outbreaks are being documented with improved understanding of antiviral treatment using Tecovirimat, which reduces symptom duration by approximately 6 days.
- Transmission mainly occurs via close physical contact.
- Vaccination and containment strategies are actively employed to control outbreaks.

## 4. HIV/AIDS
- International guidelines for treatment and prevention were updated in late 2024.
- Efforts to maintain control over transmission are ongoing, with an emphasis on improving access to antiretroviral therapies worldwide.

## 5. Emerging Zoonotic Diseases (Bird Flu and Others)
- Sporadic outbreaks of zoonotic infections such as bird flu pose ongoing risks, with concerns about their pandemic potential.
- Health systems worldwide emphasize enhanced surveillance and rapid response capabilities to contain these infections.

### Summary

The year 2024 is characterized by high transmission rates of vector-borne diseases like dengue fever, persistent circulation of multiple respiratory viruses including COVID-19 and influenza, continuing challenges with mpox management, and updated strategies for HIV/AIDS care. Additionally, emerging zoonotic diseases remain a major concern requiring vigilant surveillance. Global public health responses focus on vaccination, antiviral therapies, surveillance improvements, and swift containment measures to mitigate these disease threats.
